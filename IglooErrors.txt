Errors and Fixes in IglooScore1:

Line 39 - 42:    if (score1 < score2)
                    s = score1;       //Original Statement: s = score2; Function works by subtracting lowest score from total of all 3 scores. s should not be assigned to highest value. Correction: s = score1
                 else
                    s = score2;       //Original Statement: s = score1; To continue fix of statement at line 40, s should be assigned to lowest value in comparison. Correction: s = score2

General Flaw: While not neccessarily an error, IglooScore1 fails to check if scores are negative values or are greater than 50.
              Correction: Implement code that will check for valid input.
              Inserted at Line 64:
                 //Determine if input score values are valid
		  if (s1<0 || s1>50 || s2<0 || s2>50 || s3<0 || s3>50) {
		      System.err.println("Error: scores must be between 0 and 50!");
		      return;

Errors and Fixes in IglooScore2:

Line 44: s2 = score3; //Original statement: s2 = score2; Correction: s2 should = score3.

Overall Score Method:    //Error: If 2 values are the same and 1 is different, score is not calculated correctly. Correction: 
                         //Also accounts for 3 equal scores.

		  public int overallScore()
		  {
		    //Initialized s1 and s2 to 0
		    int s, s1 = 0, s2 = 0;
		    if (score1 < score2 && score1 < score3) {
			s1 = score2;
			s2 = score3;
		    } else if (score2 < score1 && score2 < score3 ) {
			s1 = score1;
			s2 = score3; //Original statement: s2 = score2; Correction: s2 should = score3.
		    } else if (score3 < score1 && score3 < score2) {
			s1 = score1;
			s2 = score2;
		    } 
		    //Error: If 2 values are the same and 1 is different, score is not calculated correctly. Correction: New else-if statements:
		      else {
			  if(score1 == score2 && score1 < score3){
			      s1 = score1;
			      s2 = score3;
			  } else if(score2 == score3 && score2 < score1){
